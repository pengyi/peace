Stage Selection Options
       -E  Run the preprocessor stage.

       -fsyntax-only
           Run the preprocessor, parser and type checking stages.

       -S  Run the previous stages as well as LLVM generation and optimization stages and target-specific code generation, producing an assembly file.

       -c  Run all of the above, plus the assembler, generating a target ".o" object file.

       no stage selection option
           If no stage selection option is specified, all stages above are run, and the linker is run to combine the results into an executable or shared library.

       --analyze
           Run the Clang Static Analyzer.


Preprocessor Options
       -Dmacroname=value
           Adds an implicit #define into the predefines buffer which is read before the source file is preprocessed.

       -Umacroname
           Adds an implicit #undef into the predefines buffer which is read before the source file is preprocessed.

       -include filename
           Adds an implicit #include into the predefines buffer which is read before the source file is preprocessed.

       -Idirectory
           Add the specified directory to the search path for include files.

       -Fdirectory
           Add the specified directory to the search path for framework include files.

       -nostdinc
           Do not search the standard system directories or compiler builtin directories for include files.

       -nostdlibinc
           Do not search the standard system directories for include files, but do search compiler builtin include directories.

       -nobuiltininc
           Do not search clang's builtin directory for include files.
