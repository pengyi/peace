Extensions can interact with web pages or servers using content scripts or cross-origin XMLHttpRequests.
Extensions can also interact programmatically with browser features such as bookmarks and tabs.
Many extensions have a background page, an invisible page that holds the main logic of the extension
If an extension needs to interact with web pages that the user loads, then the extension must use a content script.

There are two types of background pages: persistent background pages, and event pages.
Persistent background pages, as the name suggests, are always open. Event pages are opened and closed as needed.
Unless you absolutely need your background page to run all the time, prefer to use an event page.
